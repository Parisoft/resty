# RESTy
A minimalist HTTP client made on top of [Apache HttpComponets](http://hc.apache.org/) and [Jackson Data Processor] (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome).

It's made to be simple and elegant by avoiding *[boilerplate code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code)* and a lot of configurations.
